# GrubDash
GrubDash is a mock food delivery application, built as part of a backend development project to practice building RESTful APIs, middleware validation, and complex route handling. This project demonstrates how to build a Node.js API with Express, focusing on validation, error handling, and route management.

## Features
* RESTful API: Follows REST principles to manage resources using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
* Middleware Architecture: Custom and built-in middleware functions to ensure proper data validation and avoid errors.
* Error Handling: Centralized error handling mechanism using Express middleware to capture and respond to both user and server errors.
